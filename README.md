## What Is It?

This repository is design to help those currently learning design patterns as well as to track my own learning process.
Specifically, its purpose is to provide my own content notes and source code to the [Java Design Patterns & SOLID Principles Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-java-concepts-hands-on-projects/) from Udemy.
The course provides a comprehensive overview and practical applications of SOLID design principles as well as creational, structural, and behavioural design patterns (26 in total).
